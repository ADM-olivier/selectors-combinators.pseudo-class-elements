    <h3 class="hhh">lets try adjust two selector</h3>
    <h3>i am h3</h3>
    
    
    <!-- that was exercises for selectors only, not combinators and sibling selector. -->
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <!--now we try exercises for sibing/parent cominators and selectors-->
    <!-- sibling and parent selectors are divide in 2parts and each also 2parts so 4 in total -->
    <h2>first, parent selectors are divided into 2 parts</h2>
    <p>one which targets all his descedants, and second his direct descedant only son and not grandsons</p> 
    <p>first is one which sellects all his descedants we use space btw elements parent and childrens:
    <br>div p, div h2, div span which means in div parent target all p,h2 and span elements,
    by the way p,h2 and span aren't necessary to be direct son of div element they can be grandson or p can be h2's son. but as long descedant selector targets all elements within tag.
    we write div before every element to specify we want descedant selection
    <br>f.e: div p,h2-means div's son p and all h2 element/ div p, div h2 means- p and h2 whose parent are div.
    </p>   
    <div class="div">
        <p>i'm P</p>
        <h2>i'm h2</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>i'm h3 <span>i'm span, my father is h3tag</span>
            </h3>
        </p>
        <i>i'm italic i in short</i>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>and second target only son elements and not descedant elements, no matter if we try totarget same elements, if it isn't direct son it won't be selected 
        <br>formula: div > h2/ we use more/less mark and selectors name, it can be class or id as well.
    </p>

    <div class="fdiv">
        <h3>
            <i> i'm i, my parent is h3</i>and <span>i am span, i'son and h3 grandson</span>
        </h3>
        <h5>i'm second h5</h5>
        <div>
            <h5>i'm first h5</h5>
        </div>
        <p>i'm P</p>
        <b>i'm bold b in short</b>
        <h6>i'm h6</h6>
    </div>
    <!-- that was ddescedant selector -->
    <!-- shortly review sibling selectors and we finish it also includes two parts -->
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>we target sibling selectors ~ that mark, which tergets all sibling, no  matter sequence.</p>
    <p>im p</p>
    <h6>i'm h6</h6>
    <h4>i'm h4</h4>
    <!-- we have h4 which is p sibling, so target only h4 whose sibling is p -->
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>and direct sibling, which should exactly next to element in sequence, first after element not second or third 
        <br> h6 + h2
    </p>
    <span>i'm span</span>
    <h6>i'm h6</h6>
    <h5>i'm h5</h5>
    <h6>i' m second h6</h6>
